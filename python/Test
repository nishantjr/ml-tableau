# For security reasons, Python randomizes the hash of objects by combining it with
# a random seed. This makes runs of the same program differ from one execution
# to the next making failures difficult to debug. To get around this we manually
# specify a seed.
#
# Note that there are still other sources of non-determinism such as the python
# implementation and build configuration, since object hashes are sometimes
# generated from machine pointers etc that depend on platform, memory layout
# etc.
